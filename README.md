# CS205-Prolog_Coursework

Within the CS205 Declarative Programming module at Swansea University, we were tasked with solving simple programming questions in Prolog, a logic programming language. The most challenging of those questions was to create a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle, where we needed to develop two solutions, one that listed all possible solutions for the problem, and another that was more efficient by only identifying the solutions which fit the constraints of the puzzle. 

I was the sole contributor of software for this solution, which allowed me to gain a more solid understanding of Prolog and logic programming.
